## Key Results
- `tokenized_payments.csv` found: **YES** (path: `.../tokenized_payments.csv`)  
- PAN leak scan: **PASS** — no PAN-like sequences in tokenized outputs.  
- Token uniqueness: **PASS** — tokens unique (rows = tokens).  
- Baseline config present (`pci_baseline.json`): **YES**.  
- Scan for PAN-like sequences: **PASS** (scan, no findings).

**Artifacts produced**
- `outputs/pci_evidence.csv` — summary of checks  
- `outputs/pci_checks_detail.json` — detailed run report  
- `../A_Payment_Dataflow_and_Tokenization/outputs/tokenized_payments.csv` — tokenized data (synthetic)

## Mapping to PCI DSS
- **Req 3 (Protect stored cardholder data):** tokenization + absence of PAN = evidence for compliance posture.  
- **Req 10 (Logging):** policy + validations + outputs = parcially

## Action Items (owners)
- Payments Ops: Investigate any failed tokenizations reported in `pci_checks_detail.json`.  
- Security: Implement centralized log retention as per `02_Frameworks/Data_Retention_Policy.md`.  
- GRC : Append the evidence hashes to `03_Evidence/hashes/ledger.csv`.
